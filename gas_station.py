''' There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].
    You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1).
    You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
    Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.
    E.g. 
        Input: gas = [7,5,3,2], cost = [5,4,3,5]
        Output: 0

    We have two questions:
        1. Can I travel around?
        2.  if yes where is the start point
    define diff[i] = gas[i]-cost[i]
    then if sigma i=0->n diff[i] >=0 then we can travel around, q1 is simple
    now consider q2
    if we have a range on the circle, say [i,j], j>i
    if sum[i,j] = sigma k=i->j diff[k] < 0 then we know the start point can never be in this range
    suppose i is the start point of [0..n], we can infer that:
    sum[k,i-1]<0 for any 0<=k<i-1, otherwise, k will be the solution
    so for q2, we simply try to find the first j, so that sum[0,j]<0, if no such j exists, 0 is the solution
